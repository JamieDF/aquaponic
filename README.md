This repo contains a couple projects relating to sensor reporting using raspberryPI.  There are two branches.


# greenhouse_monitor
This branch was set up for recording information inside a greenhouse,  mainly as a gauge to figure out what plants could be grown at different times of year.  It uses a BMP280 sensor for temperature, humidity & pressure recording.  


# fishtank
The other branch(used as the main) is for monitoring the temperature of a small indoor fish tank.    This uses the same sensor as the greenhouse branch for monitoring the room's environment,  in addition to the DS18B20 sensor which is used for measuring the water's temperature.  This branch also features the use of a small LCD screen that outputs current readings from the sensors.
